# pomodoro-timer
This Python code implements a Pomodoro timer, which is a time management technique that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.


This code can be used to implement a Pomodoro timer, which can help you to improve your focus and productivity. To use the timer, simply click the start button. The timer will start counting down, and you will be notified when the interval is complete. During the work interval, try to focus on your task and avoid distractions. After the interval is complete, take a short break before starting the next interval.

You can adjust the length of the work and break intervals to suit your needs. The default settings are 25 minutes for work intervals and 5 minutes for short breaks. You can also change the length of the long break, which is triggered after every 4 work intervals.

To reset the timer, click the reset button. This will cancel the currently running timer task and set the text of the timer label to "00:00".
